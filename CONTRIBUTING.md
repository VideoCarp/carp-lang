Welcome to the contributing guidelines!<br>
You are fully allowed to contribute for anything you think helps the language.<br>
It can be as simple as adding 1 character to the lexicon, or as large as fixing up some code generation.<br>
We allow other languages, other than Python as long as they can work with the compiler.<br>
However, we're planning to write this compiler in this language, after the first Python release is done.<br>
Once that happens, the compiler will be rewritten in this language, the benefits are easier contributions, and faster compilation speed.

If you would like to contribute, we'd prefer Python for this exact release, otherwise for a higher version, we'll use this language.
