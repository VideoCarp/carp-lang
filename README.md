In-progress compiled language.<br>
This language is aimed at simplicity.

Currently read-only unless contributing or testing, completely unready.
Do not use any of the files in this repository elsewhere.

Both the lexer and syntax analyzer are unfinished.

Notices:<br>
* Lexer needs an update.
It's checking whitespace, we wouldn't want that later, this is just for testing right now.
* The language is a work in progress.
Currently does not run.
